# Chronopolis 5k Beatfox - CSound Rhythm Generation Device

This is a free Csound generative beat tool - part of a larger compositional environment I'm building.

It will constantly create perfectly looped rhythms that can easily be dropped into a program like Ableton Live.

Leave it running all night, and you'll wake up with hundreds of loops in your folder!

Here are some audio examples: https://soundcloud.com/micahfrank/sets/chronopolis5k-beatfox

• All you need is a Csound compiler like CSound QT https://csoundqt.github.io/

• Load up the Beatfox.csd file, hit "Run" (command + R) and watch it go.

Disclaimer: This software is not thoroughly tested. Although it works fine on my system, Csound can have "temperamental" moments. Please try it out first with your speakers/headphones turned down.

To do

• offline rendering
• triplets and 32nd notes
• rolls
• more accurate density control 
• option to create more repetitive beats
